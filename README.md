# Tic Tac Toe (Object-Oriented Python)
A console-based **Tic Tac Toe** game built in **Python** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Designed to practice modular class design, control flow, and turn-based game logic.

---

##  Overview
This project recreates the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game for two players (or human vs. computer).  
It demonstrates object-oriented design through separate classes for the **Board**, **Player**, and **Game**, each handling specific responsibilities.

---

##  Concepts Practiced
- **OOP design:** Encapsulation, abstraction, and class interaction  
- **Control Flow:** Turn-based logic, conditional checks, and input validation  
- **2D Arrays:** Representing and updating a 3x3 game grid  
- **Error Handling:** Preventing invalid or duplicate moves  
- **Replay Feature:** Option to restart the game after completion  

---

##  Classes
### `Board`
- Manages the 3x3 grid  
- Displays the board  
- Checks for wins or ties  

### `Player`
- Stores the player's symbol (`X` or `O`)  
- Handles move input or random AI moves  

### `Game`
- Manages game turns and overall control flow  
- Handles starting, resetting, and finishing the game
